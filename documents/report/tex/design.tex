\subsection{Communications Modules}
The simulator itself should not prescribe a set way of performing communications routing, rather it is up to the user to specify the routing algorithm they wish to use. This needs to be done in a way which makes it easy to specify different routing algorithms for different nodes in a simulation, i.e. there is not one set algorithm for each simulation. This is useful, for example, if one wishes to simulate a network of quadcopters backed up by a series of stationary nodes on the ground. In terms of extensibility, it should also be possible to package, distribute, and import implementations for different communications algorithms.

Starting with the first problem, that is the ability to specify different routing algorithms for different nodes in the same simulation, it is clear that the specification of the routing protocol should apply to individual nodes rather than to simulations. To this end, it was decided to break out the communications functions for each node to a separate communications module. This provides a level of abstraction for messageable programs, as they can then make use of generic send and receive functions at the application level of the OSI model, while the communications module has fine grain control over the networking layer. In more practical terms, each messageable must have a communications module associated with it at instantiation, and it is functions of this object that will be called when the unit wishes to send and receive messages. The main benefit of this approach is that it allows flexibility when assigning communications modules - it is possible to either have every node in the simulation use a different type of communications object, or for each node to use an instance of the same object. This provides a very obvious standard for reusing communications code between simulations.

When considering the second problem mentioned above regarding the packaging, distribution, and importing of routing functions, it was determined that this could be best achieved by combining collections of implementations into libraries and allowing the user to make use of these libraries as appropriate when writing a drone program. This makes it easy to mix and match different algorithms from different sources, and means that in order to use a particular approach, one need only link a program against the appropriate communications library. It also allows different contributors to use identical or overlapping namespaces.

It is necessary at this stage to determine exactly what responsibilities a communications module has, as well as the interface it should expose to its messageable. The most obvious function required of a component designed to communicate is to send information. To this end the communication module must be able to take a message and broadcast it to other nodes in the network. Exactly how this is achieved is dependant on the routing algorithm involved, but it is expected that most implementations will receive a message from the messageable, do some intermediate processing (perhaps to determine the best route to take) and then call the \textit{Environment::broadcast} function to pass the message to the simulated hardware (handled by the simulation environment).

If we are able to send messages via a communications module then it stands to reason that we should also be able to receive messages as well. Thus, there must also be a way for the communications module to transfer messages it has received from the environment to its messageable. This can be achieved by providing a callback function to the environment, which can be invoked when there is a message to deliver. An alternative method which instead provides asynchronous message passing is for each communications module to have a queue of incoming messages for it to process, which it should check at regular intervals. Both of these messages have merit, given that interrupt driven message delivery can become problematic when the network is flooded with messages (no other tasks can be done as the message interrupt is constantly called over routine code), and the asynchronous approach can lead to problems when it is paramount that a message be delivered immediately (such as a command to ground a malfunctioning drone). Given that both of these solution are optimal only some of the time, it was decided that both should be included in the simulator as methods of receiving messages.

The module also needs some way of performing tasks which are not triggered by the arrival of new messages. In order to facilitate these time or state driven processes, communications modules need to have a function which is run independently of the send/receive functions which either loops or is called continuously. It is also clear that one should be able to trigger the pushing out or pulling in of messages from this function, to allow for the use of non-data packets (perhaps, again, to determine the optimum route to the destination). For the purposes of simplicity the simulator calls the processing function once when the simulation is run, leaving the problem of how it is terminated.

So, the must be some condition upon which a communications module terminates, lest the simulation run indefinitely. If the threads for a messageable and its communication object were associated with each other then it would be possible to terminate both when the former exits. This can also be achieved by having the program notify the communications module that execution is complete and that it should terminate. The latter option was chosen due to the fact that it simplified the construction of the simulator, and made it easier to modify the relationship between messageable objects and communications modules in the future, for example to change the relationship from one to one to one to many (so that a base station could have separate communication interfaces to other stationary nodes and to aerial units). We devised a de facto standard for this which was to send a message with no addressing information containing only the payload ``KILL''. With the aim of flexibility, developers are at liberty to devise other methods for future communication module implementations.

Underpinning all of the above design decisions is the idea of a common specification of a message. With the view of defining this, it would be sensible to expect all messages to be serialisable as text so that they can be safely transmitted across a real world network. Beyond that it is useful to be able to label messages so that perfunctory filtering can be carried out on incomming traffic without the need for in-depth inspection. Routing model will invariably require more than this, as it does not even include space for a payload or addressing (which are both quite useful when delivering messages), but it serves as a definition of the bare minimum which can be expected. 

Given the above it must be possible for the base message model to be extended by individual implementations, given that the basic object will remain simple enough that every included feature is required by \textit{all} implementations. It is useful to have an extension of the message class which has a payload, and also one which additionally includes addressing information. These modules serve a dual purpose of being able to test the simulator functions as well as being useful to build upon for more complex communications. It is not required to plan such implementations, as it is expected that they will already have their own specifications (such as AODV in our reference code).
