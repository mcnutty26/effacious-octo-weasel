\section{Acknowledgements}
We would like to thank a few people in particular for helping us through the vast amount of research and development that was undertaken as part of this project. Our project supervisor Arshad Jhumka has helped guide us, and the advice he gave us when we were considering changing the direction of the project was invaluable. In addition, campus security were very understanding when asked to retrieve one of the drones used for testing from the roof of the maths building, and spared us what could have been a lot of embarrassment and trouble. On a lighter note, we would also like to thank USB Man and Will's rubber duck, who both made development immeasurably smoother.

\section{Introduction}
Drones have exploded into the public conciousness in recent years, for reasons both good and bad. With companies such as Amazon using drones for delivery, and many studios using them for filming, it is clear that they will become and remain a part of everyday life. Research into networks of drones is still young, and requires a specific set of tools. This project aims to create a new application for simulating drone networks to aid both academic progress and outreach. With a focus on adaptability, it is hoped that octoDrone can be used as a domain specific testing tool which is generic enough to be deployable to most types of consumer and commercial hardware available.

This report will provide a comprehensive analysis of the project undertaken by our group. There will be a background summary of the key components in this field, as well as a discussion of the ongoing research, development, and production being carried out. An analysis of the potential problems for which a solution can be found in drone networks will be supplied, and justification given for the resulting aims and objectives of our group. The report will detail the design, implementation, and testing of the solution, including considerations for the management of the project. Finally, the project outcome will be evaluated, followed by a conclusion reflecting on the success of the project and considerations for future works.
